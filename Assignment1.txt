2. Discussions:
2.1.1. Purpose of a Primary Key:
A primary key serves as a unique identifier for the records and ensures data integrity by preventing duplicate records.

2.1.2. Difference between a DBMS and a Database:
A database is a structured collection of data, while a DBMS is software used to manage and manipulate databases.

2.1.3. Importance of Normalization:
Normalization is important in database design to eliminate redundancy and dependency, thereby improving data integrity and reducing the chances of data anomalies.
